Install Composer\r\n\r\nAs Symfony2 uses [Composer][1] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way\r\nto create a new project is to use it.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have Composer yet, just run the following command from your project directory\r\n\r\n    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php\r\n\r\nThen, install dependencies using...\r\n\r\n    php composer.phar install\r\n\r\nIt should install all required vendor bundles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Copy app/config/parameters.yml.dist to app/config/parameters.yml and add in your own database/mailer configuration. Then run the following command from the project directory in your terminal...\r\n\r\n    php app/console doctrine:schema:create\r\n\r\nThis should create your database schema from the entities in the bundles located in the `src` folder. If there are any problems ensure that your database privileges and credentials are okay.\r\n\r\n[1]:  http://getcomposer.org/\r\n","name":"Tickit","tagline":"Open Source Support & Ticket System based on Symfony2 Framework","note":"Don't delete this file!
