Install Composer\r\n\r\n   As Symfony2 uses [Composer][1] to manage its dependencies, Tickit manages external libraries the same way.\r\n\r\n   If you don't have Composer yet, just run the following command from your project directory\r\n\r\n        curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php\r\n\r\n   Then, install dependencies using...\r\n\r\n        php composer.phar install\r\n\r\n   It should install all required vendor bundles.\r\n\r\n2. Copy `app/config/parameters.yml.dist` to app/config/parameters.yml and add in your own database/mailer configuration.\r\n\r\n3. Run the following command from the project directory in your terminal...\r\n\r\n        php app/console doctrine:schema:create\r\n\r\n   This should create your database schema from the entities in the bundles located in the `src` folder. If there are any problems ensure that your database privileges and credentials are okay.\r\n\r\n4. Import data fixtures by running the following command in your project directory...\r\n\r\n        php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load\r\n\r\n[1]:  http://getcomposer.org/","tagline":"Open Source Support & Ticket System based on Symfony2 Framework"}
