1. Install Composer

As Symfony2 uses [Composer][1] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way
to create a new project is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, just run the following command from your project directory

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, install dependencies using...

    php composer.phar install

It should install all required vendor bundles
